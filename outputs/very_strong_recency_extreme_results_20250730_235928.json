    "question": "black hole is to spacetime as sinkhole is to",
    "expected": "ground",
    "response": "The analogy \"black hole is to spacetime as sinkhole is to\" can be understood by considering the relationship in the first pair. A black hole is a region in spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It significantly affects the fabric of spacetime.\n\nTo find a suitable analogy, consider the nature of a sinkhole. A sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer. The relationship here is about the medium affected: spacetime for a black hole and the ground or surface for a sinkhole.\n\nGiven this understanding, the most fitting completion for the analogy would be \"ground\" or \"surface,\" as a black hole affects spacetime and a sinkhole affects the ground or surface.",

    "question": "dream is to subconscious as hallucination is to",
    "expected": "consciousness",
    "response": "The analogy \"dream is to subconscious as hallucination is to\" suggests a relationship between dreams and the subconscious mind, and asks for a similar relationship with hallucinations. In this context, a hallucination is often related to the conscious mind, or more specifically, the perception or mind. Therefore, the most fitting answer would be \"perception\" or \"mind.\"",

    "response": "In this analogy, the word \"keystone\" is to \"arch\" as a central or crucial component that supports the structure. Similarly, a \"thesis\" is a central or crucial component of an academic paper or argument.

    "question": "fossil is to rock as memory is to",
    "expected": "brain",
    "response": "The analogy \"fossil is to rock as memory is to\" is looking for a relationship similar to how a fossil is related to a rock. A fossil is typically preserved within or made from rock, suggesting a relationship of containment or preservation. \n\nGiven that context, a memory is often preserved or contained within the mind. Therefore, the most fitting answer for this analogy is \"mind.\" \n\nSo, \"fossil is to rock as memory is to mind.\"",
